# NFL Game Outcome Predictor - Technical Model Documentation

## Model Overview

This document provides a comprehensive technical breakdown of the NFL Game Outcome Predictor's machine learning model, optimized for **88.1% accuracy** through extensive hyperparameter optimization and feature engineering.

## Architecture Summary

**Final Model**: XGBoost Classifier with StandardScaler + PCA preprocessing
**Performance**: 88.1% CV accuracy, 78.8% test accuracy
**Training Data**: NFL play-by-play data (2015-2024, 300K+ plays)
**Features**: 52 engineered features → 15 PCA components (96% explained variance)

## Data Pipeline

### 1. Data Ingestion (`main.py`)

#### Raw Data Sources
- **Play-by-Play Data**: `nfl_data_py.import_pbp_data(years)`
  - ~30,000 plays per season
  - Includes EPA, down/distance, field position, play type
  - Years: 2015-2024 (10 seasons)

- **NFL Schedules**: `nfl_data_py.import_schedules(years)`
  - Game results, scores, home/away designations
  - Used for labeling (win/loss, point differential)

#### Data Processing Functions

**`load_and_prepare_pbp(years)`**
- Downloads and caches NFL play-by-play data
- Adds derived metrics (EPA, success indicators)
- Handles missing data and data type optimization
- Returns enhanced play-level DataFrame

**`offensive_stats(season_df)`**
Aggregates offensive performance per team-game:
```python
# Key offensive metrics (16 features)
'epa_per_play', 'success_rate', 'explosive_rate',
'third_down_conv_rate', 'red_zone_td_rate', 'pass_rate',
'play_action_rate', 'shotgun_rate', 'total_yards', 'plays',
'touchdowns', 'sack_rate', 'pressure_sack_rate', 'turnovers',
'takeaways', 'score'
```

**`defensive_stats(season_df)`**
Aggregates defensive performance (what teams allow):
```python
# Key defensive metrics (16 features)
'allowed_epa_per_play', 'allowed_success_rate', 'allowed_explosive_rate',
'third_down_conv_rate_allowed', 'red_zone_td_rate_allowed',
'allowed_pass_rate', 'allowed_play_action_rate', 'allowed_shotgun_rate',
'allowed_total_yards', 'allowed_plays', 'allowed_touchdowns',
'pressure_sack_rate', 'takeaways', 'turnovers_allowed',
'allowed_score'
```

**`add_momentum_simple(df, metric, ema_span)`**
Momentum calculation using Exponential Moving Average:
```python
# Optimal configuration (determined through testing)
metric = "explosive_rate"  # Best performing momentum metric
ema_span = 5              # Optimal EMA window
```

### 2. Feature Engineering (`predictor.py`)

#### Dataset Assembly (`assemble_team_game_dataset`)

**Data Merging Process**:
1. Merge offensive stats with NFL schedules → Add opponents
2. Merge with defensive stats (opponent perspective)
3. Add game outcomes (win/loss, point differential)
4. Calculate strength of schedule features
5. Add momentum features (explosive_rate, 5-game EMA)

**Strength of Schedule Features** (`calculate_opponent_strength`):
```python
# 5 additional features per team-game
'opp_season_epa_avg',     # Opponent's season EPA average
'opp_recent_form_epa',    # Opponent's last 4 games EPA
'opp_win_pct_to_date',    # Opponent's win percentage
'opp_strength_ranking',   # Opponent's EPA ranking
'opp_composite_strength'  # Weighted composite score
```

#### Final Feature Set (52 → 15 via PCA)

**Feature Categories**:
- **Offensive Metrics**: 16 features (team perspective)
- **Defensive Metrics**: 16 features (opponent stats allowed)
- **Strength of Schedule**: 5 features (opponent quality)
- **Momentum**: 1 feature (explosive_rate EMA)
- **Game Context**: 14 features (home/away, scores, etc.)

**Total**: 52 engineered features before PCA transformation

### 3. Model Architecture

#### Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
Pipeline([
    ("scaler", StandardScaler()),    # Feature normalization
    ("pca", PCA(n_components=15)),   # Dimensionality reduction
    ("model", XGBClassifier())       # Final classifier
])
```

#### Optimal XGBoost Configuration
**Hyperparameters** (determined through extensive grid search):
```python
XGBClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,        # 88.1% CV score (optimal)
    max_depth=3,            # Prevents overfitting
    learning_rate=0.1,      # Balanced learning rate
    subsample=0.8,          # Row sampling for generalization
    colsample_bytree=0.9,   # Feature sampling
    random_state=42,        # Reproducibility
    eval_metric='logloss'   # Classification metric
)
```

#### PCA Configuration
```python
PCA(n_components=15, random_state=42)
# Selected for 96% explained variance
# Reduces 52 features → 15 components
# Eliminates multicollinearity
```

### 4. Training & Validation

#### Temporal Data Splits (Season-Based)
```python
# Prevents data leakage with proper temporal ordering
train_seasons = [2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020]  # 6 seasons
val_seasons = [2021, 2022]                              # 2 seasons
test_seasons = [2023, 2024]                             # 2 seasons
```

#### Cross-Validation Results
```python
# Model comparison (5-fold time-series CV)
models_tested = {
    "xgboost": 88.1,      # ✅ WINNER (current model)
    "random_forest": 87.3, # Removed in optimization
